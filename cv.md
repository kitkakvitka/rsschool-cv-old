## Code example
``` 
function multiply (a, b) {
return a * b
}
``` 
## Experience
I have no experience in programming but I can do different tasks related to the learning process, development and implementation of training courses (including distance). I can also write excellent texts in Ukrainian and Russian.
I hope that my soft skills will help me find a new job in six months, because now I'm still learning. I think it will be Frontend development but in general I'm ready to try different positions.
